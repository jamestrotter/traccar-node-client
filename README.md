# traccar-node-client
A node client for pushing GPS updates from GPSD to a Traccar server

Notable features:
1. When network is down it will cache messages, allowing for full history when network resumes
2. different send rates for if the device is static or moving, allowing lower data rates for static devices.

# example config.json

    {
        "gps_device": "/dev/ttyACM0",
        "gpsd_host": "localhost",
        "gpsd_port": 2947,
        "send_interval": 20000,
        "static_send_interval": 60000,
        "static_distance_threshold": 1,
        "static_distance_measure_time": 1000,
        "server_url": "http://localhost:5055",
        "device_id": 7812
    }

Config Options:
- `"gps_device"` - the device reported by GPSD
- `"gpsd_host"` - hostname/ip/url of machine running GPSD
- `"gpsd_port"` - GPSD port
- `"send_interval"` - interval between sending when not static (i.e in motion)
- `"static_send_interval"` - interval between sending when static (i.e not in motion)
- `"static_distance_threshold"` - distance in meters between GPS updates reported from GPSD to be classed as not "static"
- `"static_distance_measure_time"` - the number of milliseconds worth of GPSD updates to use to calculate distance moved. the default values of 1m & 1000ms equates to ~2mph.
- `"server_url"` - traccar server url (inc. port) for OsmAnd updates
- `"device_id"` - Device ID to send to traccar
